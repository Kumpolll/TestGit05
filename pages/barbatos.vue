        "Once a mere elemental spirit who existed among the winds, the entity known as Barbatos gained power through the faith of the people of Old Mondstadt during their rebellion against Decarabian, the God of Storms and founder of the nation of Mondstadt. After Decarabian's death, Barbatos ascended to godhood as the Anemo Archon and reestablished Mondstadt in its current form.
        Currently, Barbatos wanders the world as the bard Venti, although he is mostly seen around Mondstadt."
